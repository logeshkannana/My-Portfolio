            <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>
            <p>Web development involves building and maintaining websites. It encompasses everything from creating simple static pages to complex web applications. Web developers use languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design and implement the look and functionality of a website. They also work with backend technologies such as databases and server-side scripting to create dynamic, interactive experiences.</p>

            <h2>What is App Development?</h2>
            <p>App development refers to the process of creating software applications for various platforms, such as mobile devices and desktops. This can involve developing native apps for specific operating systems (like iOS or Android) or cross-platform apps that work across multiple devices. App developers use programming languages such as Swift, Java, Kotlin, or frameworks like React Native and Flutter to build functional and user-friendly applications.</p>
